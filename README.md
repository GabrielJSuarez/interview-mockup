## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.2
- Ruby on Rails v6.1.3.2
- HTML 5
- Bootstrap 5 css
- SASS pre-processor with 7-1 architecture

Bootstrap 5 was used due to it's simplicity to implement with Rails 6 and because it offered all the design tools needed to stream line the build process of the mockup.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby v2.7.2
- Ruby on Rails v6.1.3.2
- Postgres: >=9.5
